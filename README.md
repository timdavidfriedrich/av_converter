# AV-Converter

A hardware-accelerated, lossless-focused media converter built for Android.


## Scope note

This project is currently configured specifically for my own phone's hardware to process my digi 
cam's avi footage to mp4, directly from USB-C storage. While the architecture is universal, the
current preset is tuned for this specific high-bitrate, grain-preservation workflow.
